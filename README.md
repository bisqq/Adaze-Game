I had this idea to make a maze game based on music. So the player would input a song of there choice, which then I would used to implement into an audio visualizer. To prevent anyone from cheating I made the exact cubes that were playing the frequencies rise as the player got closer to it. Although the plugin in Unreal Engine to this day is still in beta, I have looked around and seen some people package the game which works fine. So based on that I will be coming back to work on this project.

The video below demonstrates the wall in action(test), I used a softer song compared to a hard hitting to demonstrate that it doesn't matter what song you use, you still can't cheatðŸ˜†.

## Mobile Version
In the mobile version I worked on implementing a gyroscope so you would have to move your phone in order to look around which completely eliminates the look(left) joystick. This small trick makes it just more immersive.

## Audio Visualizer
The way this visualizer works is we have an `Audio Controller` that handles the audio input. We first create a function called `Set Indexes` to set the frequency and amplitude index into an array.

After that we create another function called `Calculate Equalizer`, this takes each equalizer objects from the array and transform it.

The final function called `Sort Equalizer` sorts the `Equalizer Object Array` by checking the `Actor Tag`.

In the main graph on `Event Tick` we call the built in function `Calculate Frequency Spectrum` we input the sound and start the time. This outputs a `float` array where we then input `for each` spectrum of the `Equalizer Object Array`, we set some max and min height for the `Frequency Spectrum Array` and output it to `Set Actor Scale 3D`.

On Event BeginPlay we grab all instances of the `BP_Audio` Class and insert it into the `Equalizer Object Array`. The Class just has a cube with a collision box on it.

## Rising Wall
We create a collection with a `vector4`. Now in the material editor we call that collection as a parameter and mask out only the `RBG`, this is where we take in position. We then call in the `Actor Position` and set some parameters. Now we input all those into a `SphereMask`. This mask is used to caclulate if the player is in the radius, and if they are we adjust the `World Position Offset` in the output node.

The emissive colour is pretty basic we just lerp between 2 colours using the `Time` and a sine node. We then plug that into the `emissive` output.

One last thing I might inlcude is the tron effect or a mix of the fill and tron.
